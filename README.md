# High Availability Smart Taxi Distributed System
  
## Introduction
This project aims to build an online Easy Ride Booking system, which enables users to upload their trip orders and helps them to match the drivers according to their pickup location and drivers' realtime position.   More specifically, this project is built up with four important conponents, which is listed as follows:
- **Front-end pages** <br> Used for users to interact with the system including registering their account, logging in, making trip order, updating driver's realtime position, updating the trip status, etc.
- **Back-end API** <br> Used to realize the business logic of system including processing the front-end request, proceeding with user inputs, manipulating the databases, etc.
- **Databases** <br> Used to store data of user information, driver information, trip information as well as drivers' realtime position information.
- **Middleware** <br> Used to speed up the process of reading driver's realtime position from front-end and cut down the QPS of Database server.
